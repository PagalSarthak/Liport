This Python script is designed to help Linux users troubleshoot and find solutions for their issues by searching relevant forums. It integrates the Reddit and Stack Exchange platforms, specifically targeting Linux-related subreddits and Unix Stack Exchange for problem-solving. Upon execution, it automatically detects the user's Linux distribution by reading the /etc/os-release file, and based on this, it searches the appropriate subreddit on Reddit. Additionally, it queries Stack Exchange for solutions related to the user's query. The results, including titles and links, are presented in a colorful and easy-to-read format, with error handling in case no solutions are found or external requests fail. Users can enter a query to search for Linux-related solutions, and they can type 'exit' to quit the program.
